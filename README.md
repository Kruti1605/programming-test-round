Problem Statement: Problem Statement: Allocating Products to Templates Based on Layouts

Worked on frontend only

Created templates in 'app-layout-templates' compnent
Added a link to redirect to previous tab which is a form to get layout.

Created form to fetch the layout of the template.
According to the layout the product names can be added (Pending).
According to layout the product_name form is loaded with the 'n' number of field needed for layout. (For eg., layout=1:1, product_name fields count will be 2.)

Kept all the static data.

Steps to execute:
git clone "https://github.com/Kruti1605/programming-test-round.git"

cd my-app

npm install

ng serve
